This was fun project to do on the side. Functionalities provided by the app:
1. Addition of new pixels to the screen 
2. Change colors of existing pixels 
3. Deletion of the pixels 

The project is made using React and uses local React component state management to maintain the info about all the pixels. 
The pixel size is set to 25px. Have some fun with it, you can download the repository and run a local server to test the app.
